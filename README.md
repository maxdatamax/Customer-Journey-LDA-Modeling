# Customer-Journey-LDA-Modeling

## Overview
<a href ='http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf'> Latent Dirichlet Allocation </a> (LDA) is a statistical model that extracts various topics from documents. It is usually used to cluster words by theme but I used it to cluster customer journeys for <a href='https://www.clickfox.com/'> Clickfox </a>. I found this problem incredibly interesting because it expands the application of Natural Language Processing to non-natural language data. The goal of this project was to develop insights from modeling these customer journies with LDA.

## Status
Current status of this project is open. This means that there will inevitably be bugs and issues in this code. Furthermore, this readme is still under construction.

## Process
<img src='images/optimal.png' height="300", width="375"><br>
This process involved numerous steps:
<ul>
    <li>Formatting the data properly
    <li>Building a prototype LDA model using Gensim
    <li>Developing preliminary visualizations for the model results
    <li>Tweaking the LDA model for optimization
    <li><strong>(Yet to come)</strong> Interpreting the model results
    <li><strong>(Yet to come)</strong> Gaining insights from these results
    <li><strong>(Yet to come)</strong>Creating visualizations to communicate these insights
</ul>
